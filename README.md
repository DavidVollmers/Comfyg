> Comfy configuration/settings/secrets management and distribution platform

Comfyg is the answer to the questions *"Where do I store my configuration? Where my secrets? And what about settings I
want to change at runtime?"*.

It is similar to [Azure App Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview),
but also supports secrets, change detection and
multiple [layers of security](https://docs.comfyg.com/docs/security.html).

And most importantly it is open-source and free to [use](https://docs.comfyg.com/docs/hosting.html)!

## Features

- Easy [local setup](https://docs.comfyg.com/docs/getting_started.html)
- Powerful [Command-Line Interface](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Comfyg.Cli)
- [Security](https://docs.comfyg.com/docs/security.html) as a core principal
- Flexible [hosting](https://docs.comfyg.com/docs/hosting.html)
