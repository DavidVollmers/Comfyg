# What is Comfyg?

Comfyg is the answer to the question *"Where do I store my configuration? Where my secrets? And what about settings I
want to change at runtime?"*.

It is similar to [Azure App Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview),
but also
supports secrets, settings and change detection.
