## Name

`comfyg setup client` - Registers a new client on the connected Comfyg store.

## Synopsis

```shell
comfyg setup client <CLIENT_ID> <FRIENDLY_NAME> [-k|--keys <KEYS>]

comfyg setup client -?|-h|--help
```

## Description

The `comfyg setup client` command registers a new client on the connected Comfyg store.

If the setup succeeds, the CLI will print out the information of the created client and its client secret.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to copy and save the client secret somewhere secure since you cannot access it afterwards.
> 
> If you loose the client secret you can no longer use the created client.

## Arguments

- `CLIENT_ID`

  The ID of the client to create. This must be unique for the connected Comfyg store.

- `FRIENDLY_NAME`

  The user friendly display name which is used for the created client.

## Options

- `-k|--keys <KEYS>`

  Path to a RFC 7468 PEM-encoded file containing the public key portion of the client secret and the private key portion for end-to-end encryption. If not provided, a symmetric client secret will be generated by the Comfyg store and no encryption will be applied.

## Examples

- Register a new client with the ID "test" and the friendly name "Test Client":

  ```shell
  comfyg setup client "test" "Test Client"
  ```
